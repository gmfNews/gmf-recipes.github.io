I use a large and small pizza cutter to cut out the GB pieces.   I also roll my GB out on lightly floured parchment, cut out the pieces and pull away the excess to use again.  Brush away any excess flour and bake.  Slide off on to a really sturdy rack.  Also, a foam core board is not strong enough to hold a fully decorated house of this size.  I use  22\" x 22\" hard density fiberboard.  When Christmas is over, I throw away the house and save the board for next year.  Decorate each section before you start to put it together.",
