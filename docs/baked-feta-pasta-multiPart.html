        "description": "Whether you’re an avid TikTok user or just a casual Instagram consumer, you probably saw the feta and tomato pasta taking the social media world by storm a few years ago. It’s easy to see why the recipe has achieved such fame: Cherry tomatoes and a whole block of feta are baked until soft and melty, then tossed with garlic, basil and cooked noodles for a beautifully cheesy dish. For our version, we opted to use a short tube pasta so the sauce can get trapped inside each piece and added a pinch of flaky sea salt on top to perfectly balance the dish.",

I also added half a small onion diced as small as possible and doubled the garlic. (I LOVE garlic.) After baking for twenty minutes per the directions, I pulled it out and added the onions, garlic, and cream cheese. after 10-15 minutes, I pulled it out and mixed it all together to create the \"sauce\". I let bake an additional 10ish minutes before adding the pasta and used about 1/4 cup of the pasta sauce to make it a bit more creamy. Topped with fresh cut basil and squeezed a bit of lemon on top.

It was the feta that was the problem. It was just too intense, tangy and overpowering. And I used the sheep’s milk feta which is supposed to be milder. Basically, it only tasted like feta, not much else. Will not be making again."
