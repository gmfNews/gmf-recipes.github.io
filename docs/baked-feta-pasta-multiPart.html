        "description": "Whether you’re an avid TikTok user or just a casual Instagram consumer, you probably saw the feta and tomato pasta taking the social media world by storm a few years ago. It’s easy to see why the recipe has achieved such fame: Cherry tomatoes and a whole block of feta are baked until soft and melty, then tossed with garlic, basil and cooked noodles for a beautifully cheesy dish. For our version, we opted to use a short tube pasta so the sauce can get trapped inside each piece and added a pinch of flaky sea salt on top to perfectly balance the dish.",

I also added half a small onion diced as small as possible and doubled the garlic. (I LOVE garlic.) After baking for twenty minutes per the directions, I pulled it out and added the onions, garlic, and cream cheese. after 10-15 minutes, I pulled it out and mixed it all together to create the \"sauce\". I let bake an additional 10ish minutes before adding the pasta and used about 1/4 cup of the pasta sauce to make it a bit more creamy. Topped with fresh cut basil and squeezed a bit of lemon on top.

It was the feta that was the problem. It was just too intense, tangy and overpowering. And I used the sheep’s milk feta which is supposed to be milder. Basically, it only tasted like feta, not much else. Will not be making again."

I like sliced chicken andouille sausage if I want to add a protein. I put the tomato/cheese bake in a bowl, after it is finished cooking, and use an immersion blender to mix it together, using some of the pasta water too. This makes it super creamy &amp; takes care of the hunks of tomato skins, (that some picky eaters dislike). I don’t understand how people dislike it because you can improvise &amp; put your own spin on it!"

    <h1>Baked Feta Pasta</h1>

    <p>While some social media trends aren’t built to last, this feta pasta recipe riffs on a TikTok sensation to create a dish that's creamy, cheesy and eternally satisfying.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pints (20 ounces) cherry tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One 8-ounce block feta cheese, drained</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Toss the cherry tomatoes and olive oil with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and several grinds of black pepper in a medium bowl until combined.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of generously salted water to a boil over high heat.</li>
