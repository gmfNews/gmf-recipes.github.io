I used butterfly chops and browned them in olive oil for a few minutes, then sliced an onion and layered the slices in the bottom of a glass pan. I put the chops on top of the onions and poured the mixture over them and cooked them in the oven at 375 for about a half hour. The flavor was awesome and the chops were very tender. I served it with spanish rice and a salad.\n\nMy husband is not crazy about pork chops, but he loved this! Will definitely make again and might try adding some fresh herbs to the mixture since I love to experiment."
